# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## A tidy dataset from the data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

### 1. Download the zip file with the raw data

In order to obtain the raw data, a script called `download_zipfile.R` was developped. 
In order to use the `run_analysis.R` you need to run this script frist like

```
> source('download_zipfile.R)
```

The was added in the `.gitingnore` file in order to keep this repository only with code
and avoid to load GitHub with data available in other places.

### 2. Tidying the data


### 3. A Codebook for the tidy data


### 4. Final words

My english is really nasty, my apologyzes to anyone to try to read my prose. In spanish or in
french i can do better :-).
